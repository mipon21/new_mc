I want to modiy the calculation on the chekout page, thankyou page, invoice and also on the order that is sending on the admin panel. on the current calculation you can see that on the checkout page the Tax is applied on the product price only not on the shipping cost(if shipping is not free). But i also need to apply same Tax on the Shipping price also. see on the picture. so it will be First Total(Product Price), TAX(19% on the product price), Shipping Fee, Shipping TAX(19% on the Shipping Fee) and that sould calculationg total price with it(Product Price+Tax+Shipping Fee+ Shipping Tax) = Total
